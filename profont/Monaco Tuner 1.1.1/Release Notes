Monaco Tuner 1.1.1 Release Notes30 July 1997SQ Software1.1.1  30 July 1997    Changes:        Documentation changed to update e-mail address and note Mac OS 8        compatibility.1.1  05 June 1996    Features Added:        Supports system-wide resizing of “Monaco 9”.    Bugs worked around:        There is a bad interaction between Power Macs, desk accessories and the       “safe fat trap patch header” code supplied by Apple (in <MixedMode.r>).        Monaco Tuner patches _RealFont using a "safe fat trap patch".  If  the        patched _RealFont is called for the first time from within a desk        accessory on a Power Mac, the Mac crashes.  I have verified that the crash        occurs somewhere before the first instruction of Monaco Tuner’s        _RealFont patch code is executed.   Monaco Tuner 1.1 avoids this crash        by explicitly calling _RealFont (and _FMSwapFont) once at INIT time        shortly after it installs the patches.1.0  16 April 1996 - Initial Release
