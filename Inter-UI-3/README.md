# Inter UI

![Sample](sample.png)

Inter UI is a typeface specially designed for user interfaces
with focus on high legibility of small-to-medium sized text on computer screens.

The family features a tall x-height to aid in readability of mixed-case and
lower-case text. Several OpenType features are provided as well,
like contextual alternates that adjusts punctuation depending on the shape of
surrounding glyphs, slashed zero for when you need to disambiguate "0" from "o",
tabular numbers, etc.

Inter UI is similar to Roboto, San Francisco, Akkurat, Asap, Lucida Grande and other "UI" typefaces. 
Some trade-offs were made in order to make this typeface work really well at small sizes
